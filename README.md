My personal spacemacs config, used on Windows 7 and Mac OS X.  
Put me into ~/.spacemacs.d/ and make sure to remove ~/.spacemacs .  
For Windows, I am using Emacs compiled at https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacsbinw64/

To install spacemacs and my config, simply run before starting emacs.
```
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/Oro/.spacemacs.d ~/.spacemacs.d/
```
